# React + Vite
# Exercise on components, props and arrays

This was the first exercise in the Fullstack-course provided by Helsinki University. 

It is a very simple JavaScript-application, that has a course name, what will be studied in the course and how many exercises are in each part and in total. 

The code can be found in src-folder in the "App.jsx"-file.
